ES7 react redux->extension vs code

rcc for classbased component
rfc for functional component
rconst for constructor



1. make add product component  and render it in the add product section while licking add product
 function based component

2.make product form by making productform folder and productform.component.js
 class based component

3.product form is called because it needs to be reused for edit action also
and the call back is send as a props and is call to perform api call function

the main thing is when you call add product api
you need to set token and is done by issecured method also but i am proceeding by  checking the token using if else condition
