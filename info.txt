socket and event based communication in chat component

1. make a class based component and register its route
2. first read socket communication if node.js info.txt in git hub
3.install 'socket.io-client';
4.import io from 'socket.io-client';
5.  componentDidMount(){
        this.socket = io(SOCKET_URL)
        
    }  

    6. now the connection is made and the further process is done by calling function in runsocket 
    as 
     componentDidMount(){
        this.socket = io(SOCKET_URL)
        this.runSocket();
    }  

      runSocket=()=>{
        this.socket.on('hello',(data)=>{
            console.log("message in hello event",data)
            this.socket.emit('hi',"hii from react app")
        })
    }
